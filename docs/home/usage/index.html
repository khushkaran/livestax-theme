<p>The theme can be added to your App by simply including the following <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag to your app's source code:</p>
<p><code>&lt;link href="//assets.livestax.com/theme-<version/>.css" rel="stylesheet"&gt;</code></p>
<p>Please Note: Bootstrap CSS include is not required, as the <a href="http://livestax.github.io/theme">Theme</a> handles this dependency.</p>
