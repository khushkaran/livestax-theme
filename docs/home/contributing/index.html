<p>We'd love to see new, reusable components developed by other people. If you would like to build a new component for the Theme then start by <a href="https://github.com/livestax/theme" target="_new">forking us on GitHub</a> and start building your component for us to review!</p>

<p>Once you're up and running, take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/livestax/theme/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md" target="_new">Contribution Document</a> to see how to get your changes merged in.</p>
