A <code>.media-row</code> component applies layout rules to direct descendants. Descendants are rendered side-by-side in a row, with a small gap between them. A <code>.stretch</code> class can be applied to any of these children, with the effect of expanding the width of the child until it uses all "unused" space within the parent container.
