# Theme

The [Theme] is a Twitter [Bootstrap] based CSS theme that helps Livestax App developers build consistency across their apps.
The theme extends Twitter [Bootstrap] to add components that meet common UI needs within Livestax.

## Usage

The theme can be added to your App by simply including the following `<link>` tag to your app's source code:

`<link href="//assets.livestax.com/theme-0.0.1.css" rel="stylesheet">`

Please Note: Bootstrap CSS include is not required, as the [Theme] handles this dependency.
